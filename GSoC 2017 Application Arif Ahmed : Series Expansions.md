##### Personal Information :
My name is Arif Ahmed, a second year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani Goa Campus,India. Currently I am pursuing a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science.

I use Linux Mint 18 on my workstation and PyCharm IDE for any Python related work.
I have been coding in Python(more than a year),Java(> 2 years) and C/C++(> 1 year).
I like Python the best of all the languages mentioned because it's easier to work on as compared to the others.

Along with Mathematics courses such as Complex Analysis, Discrete Mathematics, Optimization, Introduction to Algebra, Real Analysis, etc I have also completed various online courses related to Computer Science and Programming.

###### The online courses successfully completed are :
 - [Algorithms I - Princeton University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
 - [Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python(Part I)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1)
 - [Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python(Part II)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-2)
 - [Principles of Computing(Part I)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-computing-1)
 - [Principles of Computing(Part II)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-computing-2)
 - [First Five Courses of Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)
